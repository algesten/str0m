//!
//! A Sans I/O WebRTC implementation in Rust.
//!
//! This is a [Sans I/O][sansio] implementation meaning the `Rtc` instance itself is not doing any network
//! talking. Furthermore it has no internal threads or async tasks. All operations are happening from the
//! calls of the public API.
//!
//! This is deliberately not a standard `RTCPeerConnection` API since that isn't a great fit for Rust.
//! See more details in below section.

//! # Usage
//!
//! The [`chat`][x-chat] example shows how to connect multiple browsers
//! together and act as an SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit). The example
//! multiplexes all traffic over one server UDP socket and uses two threads
//! (one for the web server, and one for the SFU loop).
//!
//! ## TLS
//!
//! For the browser to do WebRTC, all traffic must be under TLS. The
//! project ships with a self-signed certificate that is used for the
//! examples. The certificate is for hostname `str0m.test` since TLD .test
//! should never resolve to a real DNS name.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --example chat
//! ```
//!
//! The log should prompt you to connect a browser to https://10.0.0.103:3000 – this will
//! most likely cause a security warning that you must get the browser to accept.
//!
//! The [`http-post`][x-post] example roughly illustrates how to receive
//! media data from a browser client. The example is single threaded and
//! is a bit simpler than the chat. It is a good starting point to understand the API.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --example http-post
//! ```
//!
//! ### Real example
//!
//! To see how str0m is used in a real project, check out [BitWHIP][bitwhip] –
//! a CLI WebRTC Agent written in Rust.
//!
//! ## Passive
//!
//! For passive connections, i.e. where the media and initial OFFER is
//! made by a remote peer, we need these steps to open the connection.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::time::Instant;
//! # use str0m::{Rtc, Candidate};
//! // Instantiate a new Rtc instance.
//! let mut rtc = Rtc::new(Instant::now());
//!
//! //  Add some ICE candidate such as a locally bound UDP port.
//! let addr = "1.2.3.4:5000".parse().unwrap();
//! let candidate = Candidate::host(addr, "udp").unwrap();
//! rtc.add_local_candidate(candidate);
//!
//! // Accept an incoming offer from the remote peer
//! // and get the corresponding answer.
//! let offer = todo!();
//! let answer = rtc.sdp_api().accept_offer(offer).unwrap();
//!
//! // Forward the answer to the remote peer.
//!
//! // Go to _run loop_
//! ```
//!
//! ## Active
//!
//! Active connections means we are making the inital OFFER and waiting for a
//! remote ANSWER to start the connection.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::time::Instant;
//! # use str0m::{Rtc, Candidate};
//! # use str0m::media::{MediaKind, Direction};
//! // Instantiate a new Rtc instance.
//! let mut rtc = Rtc::new(Instant::now());
//!
//! // Add some ICE candidate such as a locally bound UDP port.
//! let addr = "1.2.3.4:5000".parse().unwrap();
//! let candidate = Candidate::host(addr, "udp").unwrap();
//! rtc.add_local_candidate(candidate);
//!
//! // Create a `SdpApi`. The change lets us make multiple changes
//! // before sending the offer.
//! let mut change = rtc.sdp_api();
//!
//! // Do some change. A valid OFFER needs at least one "m-line" (media).
//! let mid = change.add_media(MediaKind::Audio, Direction::SendRecv, None, None, None);
//!
//! // Get the offer.
//! let (offer, pending) = change.apply().unwrap();
//!
//! // Forward the offer to the remote peer and await the answer.
//! // How to transfer this is outside the scope for this library.
//! let answer = todo!();
//!
//! // Apply answer.
//! rtc.sdp_api().accept_answer(pending, answer).unwrap();
//!
//! // Go to _run loop_
//! ```
//!
//! ## Run loop
//!
//! Driving the state of the `Rtc` forward is a run loop that, regardless of sync or async,
//! looks like this.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use str0m::{Rtc, Output, IceConnectionState, Event, Input};
//! # use str0m::net::{Receive, Protocol};
//! # use std::io::ErrorKind;
//! # use std::net::UdpSocket;
//! # use std::time::Instant;
//! # let rtc = Rtc::new(Instant::now());
//! // Buffer for reading incoming UDP packets.
//! let mut buf = vec![0; 2000];
//!
//! // A UdpSocket we obtained _somehow_.
//! let socket: UdpSocket = todo!();
//!
//! loop {
//!     // Poll output until we get a timeout. The timeout means we
//!     // are either awaiting UDP socket input or the timeout to happen.
//!     let timeout = match rtc.poll_output().unwrap() {
//!         // Stop polling when we get the timeout.
//!         Output::Timeout(v) => v,
//!
//!         // Transmit this data to the remote peer. Typically via
//!         // a UDP socket. The destination IP comes from the ICE
//!         // agent. It might change during the session.
//!         Output::Transmit(v) => {
//!             socket.send_to(&v.contents, v.destination).unwrap();
//!             continue;
//!         }
//!
//!         // Events are mainly incoming media data from the remote
//!         // peer, but also data channel data and statistics.
//!         Output::Event(v) => {
//!
//!             // Abort if we disconnect.
//!             if v == Event::IceConnectionStateChange(IceConnectionState::Disconnected) {
//!                 return;
//!             }
//!
//!             // TODO: handle more cases of v here, such as incoming media data.
//!
//!             continue;
//!         }
//!     };
//!
//!     // Duration until timeout.
//!     let duration = timeout - Instant::now();
//!
//!     // socket.set_read_timeout(Some(0)) is not ok
//!     if duration.is_zero() {
//!         // Drive time forwards in rtc straight away.
//!         rtc.handle_input(Input::Timeout(Instant::now())).unwrap();
//!         continue;
//!     }
//!
//!     socket.set_read_timeout(Some(duration)).unwrap();
//!
//!     // Scale up buffer to receive an entire UDP packet.
//!     buf.resize(2000, 0);
//!
//!     // Try to receive. Because we have a timeout on the socket,
//!     // we will either receive a packet, or timeout.
//!     // This is where having an async loop shines. We can await multiple things to
//!     // happen such as outgoing media data, the timeout and incoming network traffic.
//!     // When using async there is no need to set timeout on the socket.
//!     let input = match socket.recv_from(&mut buf) {
//!         Ok((n, source)) => {
//!             // UDP data received.
//!             buf.truncate(n);
//!             Input::Receive(
//!                 Instant::now(),
//!                 Receive {
//!                     proto: Protocol::Udp,
//!                     source,
//!                     destination: socket.local_addr().unwrap(),
//!                     contents: buf.as_slice().try_into().unwrap(),
//!                 },
//!             )
//!         }
//!
//!         Err(e) => match e.kind() {
//!             // Expected error for set_read_timeout().
//!             // One for windows, one for the rest.
//!             ErrorKind::WouldBlock
//!                 | ErrorKind::TimedOut => Input::Timeout(Instant::now()),
//!
//!             e => {
//!                 eprintln!("Error: {:?}", e);
//!                 return; // abort
//!             }
//!         },
//!     };
//!
//!     // Input is either a Timeout or Receive of data. Both drive the state forward.
//!     rtc.handle_input(input).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Sending media data
//!
//! When creating the media, we can decide which codecs to support, and they
//! are negotiated with the remote side. Each codec corresponds to a
//! "payload type" (PT). To send media data we need to figure out which PT
//! to use when sending.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use str0m::Rtc;
//! # use str0m::media::Mid;
//! # let rtc: Rtc = todo!();
//! // Obtain mid from Event::MediaAdded
//! let mid: Mid = todo!();
//!
//! // Create a media writer for the mid.
//! let writer = rtc.writer(mid).unwrap();
//!
//! // Get the payload type (pt) for the wanted codec.
//! let pt = writer.payload_params().nth(0).unwrap().pt();
//!
//! // Write the data
//! let wallclock = todo!();   // Absolute time of the data
//! let media_time = todo!();  // Media time, in RTP time
//! let data: &[u8] = todo!(); // Actual data
//! writer.write(pt, wallclock, media_time, data).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Media time, wallclock and local time
//!
//! str0m has three main concepts of time. "now", media time and wallclock.
//!
//! ### Now
//!
//! Some calls in str0m, such as `Rtc::handle_input` takes a `now` argument
//! that is a `std::time::Instant`. These calls "drive the time forward" in
//! the internal state. This is used for everything like deciding when
//! to produce various feedback reports (RTCP) to remote peers, to
//! bandwidth estimation (BWE) and statistics.
//!
//! Str0m has _no internal clock_ calls. I.e. str0m never calls
//! `Instant::now()` itself. All time is external input. That means it's
//! possible to construct test cases driving an `Rtc` instance faster
//! than realtime (see the [integration tests][intg]).
//!
//! ### Media time
//!
//! Each RTP header has a 32 bit number that str0m calls _media time_.
//! Media time is in some time base that is dependent on the codec,
//! however all codecs in str0m use 90_000Hz for video and 48_000Hz
//! for audio.
//!
//! For video the `MediaTime` type is `<timestamp>/90_000` str0m extends
//! the 32 bit number in the RTP header to 64 bit taking into account
//! "rollover". 64 bit is such a large number the user doesn't need to
//! think about rollovers.
//!
//! ### Wallclock
//!
//! With _wallclock_ str0m means the time a sample of media was produced
//! at an originating source. I.e. if we are talking into a microphone the
//! wallclock is the NTP time the sound is sampled.
//!
//! We can't know the exact wallclock for media from a remote peer since
//! not every device is synchronized with NTP. Every sender does
//! periodically produce a Sender Report (SR) that contains the peer's
//! idea of its wallclock, however this number can be very wrong compared to
//! "real" NTP time.
//!
//! Furthermore, not all remote devices will have a linear idea of
//! time passing that exactly matches the local time. A minute on the
//! remote peer might not be exactly one minute locally.
//!
//! These timestamps become important when handling simultaneous audio from
//! multiple peers.
//!
//! When writing media we need to provide str0m with an estimated wallclock.
//! The simplest strategy is to only trust local time and use arrival time
//! of the incoming UDP packet. Another simple strategy is to lock some
//! time T at the first UDP packet, and then offset each wallclock using
//! `MediaTime`, i.e. for video we could have `T + <media time>/90_000`
//!
//! A production worthy SFU probably needs an even more sophisticated
//! strategy weighing in all possible time sources to get a good estimate
//! of the remote wallclock for a packet.
//!
//! # Crypto backends
//!
//! str0m supports multiple crypto backends via feature flags. The default is `aws-lc-rs`.
//!
//! | Feature        | Crate                 | DTLS                         | Platforms |
//! |----------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|-----------|
//! | `aws-lc-rs`    | `str0m-aws-lc-rs`     | dimpl + AWS-LC-RS            | All       |
//! | `rust-crypto`  | `str0m-rust-crypto`   | dimpl + RustCrypto           | All       |
//! | `openssl`      | `str0m-openssl`       | OpenSSL native DTLS          | All       |
//! | `apple-crypto` | `str0m-apple-crypto`  | dimpl + Apple CommonCrypto   | macOS/iOS |
//! | `wincrypto`    | `str0m-wincrypto`     | Windows SChannel             | Windows   |
//!
//! If multiple backend features are enabled, str0m automatically selects the backend in this
//! priority order: `aws-lc-rs`, `rust-crypto`, `openssl`, `apple-crypto` (Apple platforms only),
//! `wincrypto` (Windows only).
//!
//! If you disable the default features, you MUST explicitly configure an alternative
//! crypto backend either process-wide or per-instance.
//!
//! ## Process-wide default
//!
//! For applications, the easiest is to set a process-wide default at startup.
//! Note that you can use any backend crate directly without enabling its feature flag:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! // Set process default (will panic if called twice)
//! // No need to enable the "rust-crypto" feature flag
//! str0m_rust_crypto::default_provider().install_process_default();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Crypto provider per Rtc instance
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use std::time::Instant;
//! use str0m::Rtc;
//!
//! let rtc = Rtc::builder()
//!     .set_crypto_provider(Arc::new(str0m_rust_crypto::default_provider()))
//!     .build(Instant::now());
//! ```
//!
//! # Project status
//!
//! Str0m was originally developed by Martin Algesten of
//! [Lookback][lookback]. We use str0m for a specific use case: str0m as a
//! server SFU (as opposed to peer-2-peer). That means we are heavily
//! testing and developing the parts needed for our use case. Str0m is
//! intended to be an all-purpose WebRTC library, which means it also
//! works for peer-2-peer, though that aspect has received less testing.
//!
//! Performance is very good, there have been some work the discover and
//! optimize bottlenecks. Such efforts are of course never ending with
//! diminishing returns. While there are no glaringly obvious performance
//! bottlenecks, more work is always welcome – both algorithmically and
//! allocation/cloning in hot paths etc.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Output from the `Rtc` instance can be grouped into three kinds.
//!
//! 1. Events (such as receiving media or data channel data).
//! 2. Network output. Data to be sent, typically from a UDP socket.
//! 3. Timeouts. Indicates when the instance next expects a time input.
//!
//! Input to the `Rtc` instance is:
//!
//! 1. User operations (such as sending media or data channel data).
//! 2. Network input. Typically read from a UDP socket.
//! 3. Timeouts. As obtained from the output above.
//!
//! The correct use can be seen in the above [Run loop](#run-loop) or in the
//! examples.
//!
//! Sans I/O is a pattern where we turn both network input/output as well
//! as time passing into external input to the API. This means str0m has
//! no internal threads, just an enormous state machine that is driven
//! forward by different kinds of input.
//!
//! ## Frame or RTP level?
//!
//! Str0m defaults to the "frame level" which treats the RTP as an internal detail. The user
//! will thus mainly interact with:
//!
//! 1. [`Event::MediaData`][evmed] to receive full frames (audio frames or video frames).
//! 2. [`Writer::write`][writer] to write full frames.
//! 3. [`Writer::request_keyframe`][reqkey] to request keyframes.
//!
//! ### Frame level
//!
//! All codecs such as h264, vp8, vp9 and opus outputs what we call
//! "Frames". A frame has a very specific meaning for video, but this
//! project uses it in a broader sense, where a frame is either a video
//! or audio time stamped chunk of encoded data that typically represents
//! a chunk of audio, or _one single frame for video_.
//!
//! Frames are not suitable to use directly in UDP (RTP) packets - for
//! one they are too big. Frames are therefore further chunked up by
//! codec specific payloaders into RTP packets.
//!
//! ### RTP mode
//!
//! Str0m also provides an RTP level API. This would be similar to many other
//! RTP libraries where the RTP packets themselves are the API surface
//! towards the user (when building an SFU one would often talk about "forwarding
//! RTP packets", while with str0m we can also "forward frames").  Using
//! this API requires a deeper knowledge of RTP and WebRTC.
//!
//! To enable RTP mode
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "openssl")] {
//! # use std::time::Instant;
//! # use str0m::Rtc;
//! let rtc = Rtc::builder()
//!     // Enable RTP mode for this Rtc instance.
//!     // This disables `MediaEvent` and the `Writer::write` API.
//!     .set_rtp_mode(true)
//!     .build(Instant::now());
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! RTP mode gives us some new API points.
//!
//! 1. [`Event::RtpPacket`][rtppak] emitted for every incoming RTP packet. Empty packets for bandwidth
//!    estimation are silently discarded.
//! 2. [`StreamTx::write_rtp`][wrtrtp] to write outgoing RTP packets.
//! 3. [`StreamRx::request_keyframe`][reqkey2] to request keyframes from remote.
//!
//! ## NIC enumeration and TURN (and STUN)
//!
//! The [ICE RFC][ice] talks about "gathering ice candidates". This means
//! inspecting the local network interfaces and potentially binding UDP
//! sockets on each usable interface. Since str0m is Sans I/O, this part
//! is outside the scope of what str0m does. How the user figures out
//! local IP addresses, via config or via looking up local NICs is not
//! something str0m cares about.
//!
//! TURN is a way of obtaining IP addresses that can be used as fallback
//! in case direct connections fail. We consider TURN similar to
//! enumerating local network interfaces – it's a way of obtaining
//! sockets.
//!
//! All discovered candidates, be they local (NIC) or remote sockets
//! (TURN), are added to str0m and str0m will perform the task of ICE
//! agent, forming "candidate pairs" and figuring out the best connection
//! while the actual task of sending the network traffic is left to the
//! user.
//!
//! ## The importance of `&mut self`
//!
//! Rust shines when we can eschew locks and heavily rely `&mut` for data
//! write access. Since str0m has no internal threads, we never have to
//! deal with shared data. Furthermore the the internals of the library is
//! organized such that we don't need multiple references to the same
//! entities. In str0m there are no `Rc`, `Mutex`, `mpsc`, `Arc`(*),  or
//! other locks.
//!
//! This means all input to the lib can be modelled as
//! `handle_something(&mut self, something)`.
//!
//! (*) Ok. There is one `Arc` if you use Windows where we also require openssl.
//!
//! ## Not a standard WebRTC "Peer Connection" API
//!
//! The library deliberately steps away from the "standard" WebRTC API as
//! seen in JavaScript and/or [webrtc-rs][webrtc-rs] (or [Pion][pion] in Go).
//! There are few reasons for this.
//!
//! First, in the standard API, events are callbacks, which are not a
//! great fit for Rust. Callbacks require some kind of reference
//! (ownership?) over the entity the callback is being dispatched
//! upon. I.e. if in Rust we want `pc.addEventListener(x)`, `x` needs
//! to be wholly owned by `pc`, or have some shared reference (like
//! `Arc`). Shared references means shared data, and to get mutable shared
//! data, we will need some kind of lock. i.e. `Arc<Mutex<EventListener>>`
//! or similar.
//!
//! As an alternative we could turn all events into `mpsc` channels, but
//! listening to multiple channels is awkward without async.
//!
//! Second, in the standard API, entities like `RTCPeerConnection` and
//! `RTCRtpTransceiver`, are easily clonable and/or long lived
//! references. I.e. `pc.getTranscievers()` returns objects that can be
//! retained and owned by the caller. This pattern is fine for garbage
//! collected or reference counted languages, but not great with Rust.
//!
//! ## Panics, Errors and unwraps
//!
//! Str0m adheres to [fail-fast][ff]. That means rather than brushing state
//! bugs under the carpet, it panics. We make a distinction between errors and
//! bugs.
//!
//! * Errors are as a result of incorrect or impossible to understand user input.
//! * Bugs are broken internal invariants (assumptions).
//!
//! If you scan the str0m code you find a few `unwrap()` (or `expect()`). These
//! will (should) always be accompanied by a code comment that explains why the
//! unwrap is okay. This is an internal invariant, a state assumption that
//! str0m is responsible for maintaining.
//!
//! We do not believe it's correct to change every `unwrap()`/`expect()` into
//! `unwrap_or_else()`, `if let Some(x) = x { ... }` etc, because doing so
//! brushes an actual problem (an incorrect assumption) under the carpet. Trying
//! to hobble along with an incorrect state would at best result in broken
//! behavior, at worst a security risk!
//!
//! Panics are our friends: *panic means bug*
//!
//! And also: str0m should *never* panic on any user input. If you encounter a panic,
//! please report it!
//!
//! ### Catching panics
//!
//! Panics should be incredibly rare, or we have a serious problem as a project. For an SFU,
//! it might not be ideal if str0m encounters a bug and brings the entire server down with it.
//!
//! For those who want an extra level of safety, we recommend looking at [`catch_unwind`][catch]
//! to safely discard a faulty `Rtc` instance. Since `Rtc` has no internal threads, locks or async
//! tasks, discarding the instance never risk poisoning locks or other issues that can happen
//! when catching a panic.

//! If your platform isn't listed but is supported by Rust, we'd love for you to give str0m a try and
//! share your experience. We greatly appreciate your feedback!
//!
//! ### Does str0m support IPv4, IPv6, UDP and TCP?
//!
//! Certainly! str0m fully support IPv4, IPv6, UDP and TCP protocols.
//!
//! ### Can I utilize str0m with any Rust async runtime?
//!
//! Absolutely! str0m is fully sync, ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with any Rust async
//! runtime you opt for.
//!
//! ### Can I create a client with str0m?
//!
//! Of course! You have the freedom to create a client with str0m. However, please note that some
//! common client features like media encoding, decoding, and capture are not included in str0m. But
//! don't let that stop you from building amazing applications!
//!
//! ### Can I use str0m in a media server?
//!
//! Yes! str0m excels as a server component with support for both RTP API and Frame API. You can
//! easily build that recording server or SFU you dreamt of in Rust!
//!
//! ### Can I deploy the chat example into production?
//!
//! While the chat example showcases how to use str0m's API, it's not intended for production use or
//! heavy load. Writing a full-featured SFU or MCU (Multipoint Control Unit) is a significant
//! undertaking, involving various design decisions based on production requirements.
//!
//! ### Discovered a bug? Here's how to share it with us
//!
//! We'd love to hear about it! Please submit an issue and consider joining our Discord community
//! to discuss further. For a seamless reporting experience, refer to this exemplary
//! bug report: <https://github.com/algesten/str0m/issues/382>. We appreciate your contribution
//! to making str0m better!
//!
//! ### I am allergic to SDP can you help me?
//!
//! Yes use the direct API!
