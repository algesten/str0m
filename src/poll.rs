//! Readiness signalling threaded through the component tree.
//!
//! Everything below [`Rtc`][crate::Rtc] forms a tree, and both events and new
//! timeouts bubble up from the leaves. To avoid re-walking a quiescent tree on
//! every `poll_output`, each path that takes `&mut` access to a sub-component
//! is handed an armed [`Wake`] guard, threaded down like `&mut` state.
//!
//! A [`Wake`] defaults to re-polling *everything*: left untouched it signals
//! both a pending event drain and a timeout recompute. A component narrows it
//! locally — [`Wake::no_events`] / [`Wake::no_timeout`] — when it knows less
//! changed. The guard folds its (possibly narrowed) signal into the owning
//! [`Readiness`] on drop.
//!
//! The direction is deliberate: the safe default is to re-poll, and narrowing
//! is an opt-in optimization owned by the component that performed the
//! mutation. A forgotten or over-broad narrow costs at most one redundant
//! poll; it can never drop output. No component names another's scope, and
//! `Rtc` holds no knowledge of which mutation affects what.
//!
//! The app-facing API wrappers ([`DirectApi`][crate::change::DirectApi],
//! [`SdpApi`][crate::change::SdpApi], [`Channel`][crate::channel::Channel],
//! [`Bwe`][crate::bwe::Bwe]) hold an [`RtcMut`] instead of `&mut Rtc`. It arms
//! the readiness on *mutable* deref only, so a `&mut self` method that mutates
//! re-polls the tree while a `&self` reader never does — and neither has to
//! remember to call anything.

/// Change detection, à la a dirty-flag on mutable access: `deref` is a plain
/// read and never arms; `deref_mut` arms both halves (the safe default).
/// Because a `&self` method can only reach `deref` and a mutating `&mut self`
/// method reaches `deref_mut`, "mutation re-polls, reads don't" is enforced by
/// the borrow checker — a new method can't forget, and a read-only method
/// can't accidentally arm.
///
/// Deliberately has no `Drop`: the API wrappers are held in `let` bindings
/// across other `Rtc` use, and a destructor would extend their borrow to the
/// end of scope. Arming therefore happens eagerly on the mutable access.
///
/// When a mutation only affects one half of the re-poll — and especially when
/// that isn't known until the mutation is underway — take it through
/// [`RtcMut::mutate`] and narrow the returned [`Mutation`] guard.
